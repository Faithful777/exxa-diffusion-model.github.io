**A Diffusion-Based Deep Learning Approach to Protoplanetary Disk Imaging**

Protoplanetary disks—the swirling cradles of planet formation—hold essential clues about the birth of planetary systems. However, images captured from telescopes are often marred by noise that obscures these delicate structures, making it challenging to extract meaningful scientific insights. This ongoing research explores a novel **diffusion-based deep learning framework** designed to **denoise protoplanetary disk observations** while preserving their intricate physical features.

Unlike many large-scale astronomy datasets, our work is constrained by a **small collection of just 975 images**, each with **log-normal pixel distributions** and **significant outliers**. These conditions pose a unique challenge: how to leverage the power of deep learning—typically data-hungry—on a limited and noisy dataset. My approach leverages the strengths of **denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)** to learn a noise-aware generative process that can disentangle true disk structure from observational noise.
